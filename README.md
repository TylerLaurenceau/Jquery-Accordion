![accordion](http://learnersdictionary.com/media/ld/images/legacy_print_images/accord.gif)

*My first looks into using Jquery.*

Within this project I made a accordion style drop menu using Jquery and CSS.

Here is what i've learned in this project:

#Jquery
* Using `$` to call variables.
* How to use Jquery to short hand event.
* How to use the addClass and removeClass methods.
* Much better understanding of the click event listener.


#SCSS
* Using hover to change the color of text or backgrounds when the user mouses over it.
* Using transitions to make my created webpages more elegant.
* Better understanding of what `overflow` does.
